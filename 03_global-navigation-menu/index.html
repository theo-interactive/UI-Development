      <h2 class="headline">Keep learning</h2>
      <p class="copy">
        Lessons aren't just for school; we learn every time that we navigate new waters at home or at work.<br />
        So it's good that there are so many pottery, language or creative writing classes to cater to us.<br />
        These diversions can be fun and fulfilling â”€ and they keep our minds active and receptive.

      <h2 class="headline">Take time in nature</h2>
      <p class="copy">
        It sounds twee but the evidence firmly suggests that it's good for mental and physical heath.<br />
        Whether it's a morning jog around Tokyo's Yoyogi Park or 20 minutes sitting with a paperback under an elm at the end of the road,<br/>
        nature can nurture us, whether of not we're in a city.

      <h2 class="headline">Buy things once but well</h2>
      <p class="copy">
        Sustainability can mean different things.<br />
        It's great that you bought a chair made out of a plastic that can be recycled but terrible that you'll need to buy another<br />
        when it breaks in two weeks.<br />
        Surround yourself with things that you see value in and are built for the long haul.

      <h2 class="headline">Oh, and Keep a notebook handy</h2>
      <p class="copy">
        Inspiration is everywhere and small changes to our behaviour and attitude make a difference.<br />
        Half-formed thoughts tapped on phones are rarely revisited and don't stick with us in a meaningful way.<br />
        The world is a wondrous place with lots to see.<br />
        All that's left to do is take note.

      <h2 class="headline">Grow something</h2>
      <p class="copy">
        Basil for that window-box? A box hedge for the garden? A lemon tree for the balcony?<br />
        Fostering a living thing from seed is rewarding but takes patience and pluck.<br />
        It's good to grow and, in some small way, get back to the land.<br />
        Cultivation comes in many forms.
